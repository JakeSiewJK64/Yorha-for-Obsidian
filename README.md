## Yorha UI Theme:

This theme was made using the color pallete used in Nier Automata's GUI color scheme. I made it for fun so please feel free to use it. Pull requests are always welcomed to improve it.

## To install:
1.  Download the obsidian.css file.
    
2.  In Obsidian click Settings->Plugins and turn on "Custom CSS".
    
3.  Put the "obsidian.css" in your vault root folder.
    
4.  Restart Obsidian.
